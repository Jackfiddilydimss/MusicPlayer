# MusicPlayer
A low-tech MP3 player for personal use. Made in Python using Pygame, so don't judge me for the UI... please.

Free for use, for obvious reasons.

TO USE:
- Upon launch, you will be asked to input your music folder's directory.
- Input your FULL music folder directory by clicking on the input box (clearly marked). (e.g. c:\users\{username}\music).
- The rest is done for you.
- F1 - Toggle Shuffling.
- F2 - Toggle Looping.
- Left/Right arrows to skip/reverse skip a song.
- Space to pause.
